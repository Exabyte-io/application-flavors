#    1. A runtime directory for this calculation is created                       #
#    2. A Python virtual environment is created                                   #
#        - in /scratch/$USER/$JOB_ID   (for build: 'Default')                     #

#    3. This list is used to populate a Python virtual environment                #
#    4. JupyterLab is started                                                     #
